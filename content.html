        <br><br><h2>Reading and its Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3><strong>Vocabulary and Communication</strong></h3>
      One of the main benefits of reading is the improvement of <em>vocabulary</em>. Vocabulary is essential in many different parts of one&apos;s life. This includes not only job and college searching, but also in conversation. It has been proven that the more one engages in reading, the more their vocabulary is <em>enhanced</em>. This means improved communication skills. Effective communication is an important part of one&apos;s life, and it&apos;s important to take advantage of this opportunity that books provide. 
    </li>
    <li><h3><strong>Reading and Mental Health</strong></h3>
    Reading also has mental health benefits. As mentioned in the introduction prior, reading serves as a way to reduce stress. It has also been shown to  <em>reduce heart rate and blood pressure</em> &lpar;Rizzolo et al., 2009&rpar;. As one may know, stress can affect concentration and memory, as well as cause physical symptoms if not managed. It has been proven through research that reading can in fact lower stress. There are also benefits in what is considered “deep reading,” which involves reading with perception and observation. This in turn <em>improves</em> cognitive skills, such as critical thinking and empathy, which can further develop connections between others. This also applies to sleep as well. 
    </li>
    <li><h3><strong>Reading and Sleep Quality</strong></h3>
    Reading has also been shown to <em>improve</em> one&apos;s quality of sleep. Poor sleep can lead to problems such as anxiety and depression, as well as physical problems. Reading tells the brain to relax and to start preparing for sleep. It can also serve as a <em>screentime alternative</em>  to prevent any problems linked with using screens before bed. It can offer <em>complete relaxation</em>, both for the mind and body. Having an improved sleep quality has several benefits such as an improved heart, mood, and mind, as well as regulating blood sugar. 
    </li>
    <li><h3><strong>Reading and Cognitive Decline</strong></h3>
    The final benefit that will be presented here is that reading has been shown to <em>prevent</em> cognitive decline. This is also due in part to the fact that reading can <em>strengthen</em> the brain. Not only does it help in concentration, but it also has been shown to <em>increase</em> neuron connections within the brain. A 14-year study on cognitive decline in the elderly showed that constant reading has been linked with a “reduced risk of cognitive decline for older adults…” &lpar;Chang et al., 2020&rpar;. In this way one can consider reading to serve as a form of exercise for the mind. Like the body, the mind is also something that needs to be exercised on a regular basis. 
    </li>
    <li><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
    All of these are merely a few benefits that reading can offer. There are many more benefits that aren&apos;t listed here. It&apos;s encouraged that one does their own research regarding this topic. The main takeaway here is to make some time for reading, even if it&apos;s simply ten minutes a day. At the end of the day <em>everyone</em> consists of the accumulation of their habits. That is why it&apos;s important to start developing habits that lead to personal <em>growth</em>, rather than personal decline. </li>
